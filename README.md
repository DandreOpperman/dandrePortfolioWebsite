## Welcome to my portfolio

Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio.

The purpose of this website is to highlight my skills, experience and technical ability in software development. To challenge myself and improve my skills I decided to style this website using Tailwind CSS, a technology I have never worked with before. The full list of technologies I used are:

- JavaScript
- Html
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- State
- Netifly forms (for submissions from the form at the bottom of the site)
- Hosting via Netifly
