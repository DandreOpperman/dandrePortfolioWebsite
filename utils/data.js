Importantly this group project was coded in Flutter in the DART coding language. Our team decided that the two-week project phase would be an opportunity to showcase our ability to learn new technologies fast, use documentation to overcome obstacles and execute aesthetically pleasing and technically robust full-stack coding projects. For a demo and explanation of the application please watch this video https://youtu.be/zg74qv8YIL0. This project was created using: Dart, Flutter, Documentation, Trello, Figma and Agile methodology",
